## Custom biomes

You can create custom biomes with your own sprites and friction settings. Here's how:

### Creating the biome definition file

First locate the resource directory of Auto Spiel Remastered. If you have just downloaded the game it should be in `autospiel-remastered/rsc`.
Now place a file named `<your-biome-name-here>.json` and place it into the `biomes` directory, e.g. `autospiel-remastered/rsc/biomes/custom.json`.
Inside this file you can specify the different parameters of you biome. The following is the default configuration of the `grass` biome:
```javascript
{
  "name": "Wiese", // The name of your biome
  "friction": 100.0, // The friction of the road (100: no sliding, 0: won't slow down)
  "background": "rsc/sprites/backgrounds/grass.png", // location of the background image relative to the root directory
  "obstacle": "rsc/sprites/obstacles/barrier.png", // location of the obstacle image relative to the root directory
  "coin": "rsc/sprites/coins/coin.png" // location of the coin image relative to the root directory
}
```

### Creating custom sprites

#### Background

Place a png file named `<your-biome-name-here>.png` into `sprites/backgrounds` with the following dimensions and reference it in the `background` field inside of the [biome definition file](#creating-the-biome-definition-file).

Place an 80x60 png file named `<your-biome-name-here>.png` into `sprites/obstacles` and reference it in the `obstacle` field of the [biome definition file](#creating-the-biome-definition-file).

### Coin

Place a 50x50 png file named `<your-biome-name-here>.png` into `sprites/coins` and reference it in the `coin` field of the [biome definition file](#creating-the-biome-definition-file).
